# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)


# admin_role = Role.create(name: 'admin')
# moderator_role = Role.create(name: 'moderator')
# # ... other roles ...
#
# user = User.create(email: 'admin@example.com', password: 'password')
# user.roles << admin_role
